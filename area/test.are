Kasumi~
Kasumi~
Kasumi Tendou stands here, smiling as she works.
~
Kasumi is the eldest of Soun Tendou's three daughters, being 19 years
old.  She largely runs the Tendou household, cooking and cleaning and taking
care of damage control, a very important job in this family especially.  She
has black hair tied back in a ponytail, and is smiling almost all the time. 
She fails to notice all the bizarre occurrences around her, for some reason,
and generally accepts the battles between martial artists which happen in
her home on a very frequent basis, as being a normal thing.

Inside a Crashed Ship~
Here you stance in what looks like would be the center of the ship. Scrap
metal is strung out all over the floor. A computer lies on it's side smashed
to bits. In the middle there is a solid round table with a few chairs still
standing around it embeded into the floor. The others are broken from the
floor and scattered. To the north there is a door, thats dented a little,
with a small round glass piece in the center that you can see through. To the
west there is another door that leads down and out of the ship.

Entropic Force Containment Sphere~
This sphere is the terminus for the various forms of destructive energies
which are absorbed and directed by hidden syphoning devices which are
scattered throughout the many different areas which compose this plain of
existence.  Powerful forces constantly tear at anything unfortunate enough
to find itself here, and yet the most extreme individuals spend short
periods of time training in this room, using the violent environment to
accelerate the improvement of their fighting skills.  However, extended use
of this sphere can be {Rfatal{x.

Outside the Containment Sphere~
A massive black colored sphere takes up most of the space in this room. 
Tangles of tubes, wires, pipes and support structures all wind away from the
junction points where they connect with the sphere, littering the floor and
giving this ebony globe the appearance of a gigantic, alien arachnid,
crouched amidst the electronic chaos that composes it's lair.  A series of
black platforms, each one higher than the one before leads up from the
floor, to a hatch in the exact center of the containment sphere's outer
casing.  A metal railing hovers in the air alongside the platforms, to help
those not used to climbing levitating stairs.  The sphere, and the stairs,
are directly north of you.  Green lights flicker on the walls, in lines and
other regular patterns.  A small opening reveals that there is a vast
network of black cables and pipeworks, suspended over an abyss of
interminable depth.  This technological web surrounds your comparatively
tiny room, on all sides.

Gohan's Room~
In reality, this room is actually quite large.  Yet from the myriad of
objects that are scattered about, the room has a small, claustrophobic feel
to it.  A towering bookshelf stands along the east wall.  It is completely
stuffed with books on every subject possible, and a pile of even more books
lies in a heap at the bottom of it.  Along the west wall is a large desk, A
state of the art computer rests atop it, yet it would be hard to notice
underneath the massive stacks of paper and writing utensils that are nearly
spilling onto the floor.  A picture of Videl sits on the edge of the desk,
in a small frame.  The only window is along the north side of the room.  Its
open, and a breeze floats into the room, keeping the Temperature cool. 
Several pictures line up along that same wall, everything from Young Gohan
on his father's shoulder riding on the Flying Nimbus, to a golden haired
youth dressed as his mentor Piccolo, and even a poster of Saiyaman in one of
his infamous poses.  The south side of the room has a bed in the corner,
several gi's, shirts, sweatpants, and wristbands are stockpiled both on the
bed and on the floor. This room is in need of a serious cleaning, however
this place seems comfortable, despite the messiness.
