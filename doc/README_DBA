DragonBall Arena 2 was written by Matt Brown (Antor), arkaine@sympatico.ca, from 2000-2002.

I've simply run out of time to work on this anymore, so I'm releasing the code.  A lot of things are half-done, but still interesting. Be sure to check out:
   -random areas and weapons (to be extended to random items in general)
   -missions (faster method of searching for mobs)
   -fusion code
   -new skill system
   -real-time combat
   -auto-backups
   -the 'remold' script to remove old player files
Also, there is a bug that causes crashes.  It has something to do with mobs being in a NULL room after being extracted, but still attacking players.  Please find it; again, I've run out of time.

Please enjoy this code.  Thanks to the writers of all previous codebases and snippets.  Share your work too, and follow all other licenses!
